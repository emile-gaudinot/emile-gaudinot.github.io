This is my **[personal portfolio website](https://emile-gaudinot.github.io/)**, designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my professional journey. 
Here, you’ll find:
- The **projects** I’ve contributed to, 
- My **experiences**,
- My **educational background**.

Unlike my conventional CV, this portfolio offers a **more detailed** look at my work, skills, and achievements. 
You can interactively access my **Github repositories** from there.
It serves as a one-stop hub for anyone interested in learning more about me, my expertise, and how to get in touch.

All my **contact links** are centralized here for easy access.

The website is **hosted on GitHub Pages**, ensuring it’s always up-to-date and accessible to everyone.
